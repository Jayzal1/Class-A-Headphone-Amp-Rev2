Class A Headphone Amp Rev2

This is a design for a class A headphone amplifier with a case for mounting under a desk. It's pure analogue with phono rca input and a passthrough output which trigger when the amplifier is switch off. There is a built in linear pwoer supply running from a standard IEC Socket on the back panel. There are two front panel switches, left one is for power and the right one was intended to disable a 12v trigger option that was never implemented. The case is capable of being fully 3D printed. The case was built around an old headsink I had spare so if anyone would like to build this a redesign might be required to fit others. All the M3 panel screws are designed to run into [brass inserts]([url](https://www.google.com/search?q=m3+brass+inserts&rlz=1C1ONGR_en-gbGB988GB988&oq=m3+brass+inserts&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORiABDIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgHGB4yCAgDEAAYBRgeMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoICBAAGIAEGKIEMgoICRAAGIAEGKIE0gEINzgwMWowajSoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) which get melted into the 3D printed case.
